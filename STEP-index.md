# quasar-disney-mobile — STEP Index

The living roadmap. Every STEP, its status, and a one-line scope. **This is the first
place to look to understand where the project is.** Keep it current as STEPs are planned,
worked, and completed.

> Status values: **Planned** · **In progress** · **Done** (archived to `prompts/`) ·
> **Deferred** (consciously not needed now; keep a revisit trigger) ·
> **Abandoned** (reserved but won't be built — keep the row so the number is never reused).
> Flip a STEP to **In progress** when you start it, so the overlap warning can see it.
> STEP numbers are global and never reset (see `METHOD.md` §1, §8).
> **What to do next** is always derivable from this index — see the next-action resolver in
> `METHOD.md` §10.
>
> **Reserving a number (teams):** adding a STEP row *is* reserving its number, on `prompts/`'s
> shared trunk (not a `step-NNNN` branch). Pull `prompts/`, take `max + 1`, add the row, then
> **commit and push immediately** — before branching or working. If the push is rejected, pull,
> renumber, push again. Before every push, even a clean merge, scan for duplicates
> (`grep -oE '^\|[[:space:]]*STEP-[0-9]+' prompts/STEP-index.md | grep -oE 'STEP-[0-9]+' | sort | uniq -d`)
> — two appended rows merge with no
> conflict into a silent duplicate. See `runbooks/collaboration.md`.
> **Owner** = who's on it; **Repos** = the repos it expects to touch (a *projection* that may
> change — it powers the overlap warning, it doesn't reserve anything). Solo, leave them blank.

## Phase 1 — POC

> **Phase plan set in STEP-1.2** — see `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/architecture/02-phasing-roadmap.md`.
> Phase 1 is a functional POC with **visual fidelity** to supplied Disney+ reference screens, split
> into **1a** (gated by an immovable stakeholder sign-off on **2026-08-18**) and **1b** (remainder,
> undated). 1a = auth flow (welcome + credentials + inline error) · storefront with 2 config-driven
> carousel variants · two-mode theme · API contract + fetch-simulating mocks · tests for every
> reducer/middleware/hook (UI tests deferred). Later: **Phase 2** hero carousel, filter rail, details
> screen, Bitrise CI · **Phase 3** backend integration (we build no backend) · **Phase 4+** playback,
> profiles, downloads.

| STEP | Title | Owner | Status | Repos (projection) | Scope (one line) |
|------|-------|-------|--------|--------------------|------------------|
| STEP-1 | Architecture | | In progress | `quasar-disney-mobile-docs`, `prompts` | Architecture-first: design docs + ADRs, no code. Substeps = the sessions in `templates/architecture-sessions/`. Branch: `step-0001-architecture`. |

<!-- STEP-1 is the ONLY row at bootstrap. STEP-2 onward are the implementation STEPs — don't
     add them by hand: after STEP-1's review passes, run the planning session
     (templates/planning-session.md) and it outlines all the Phase-1 implementation STEPs
     here (a couple of sentences each), in dependency order after STEP-1. Each STEP's detailed
     PLAN and substeps are written later, when you start that STEP. Starting a STEP means
     planning it and stopping for approval before any substep runs. Example row shape:
     | STEP-2 | Scaffold repos & skeleton | | Planned | `quasar-disney-mobile-api` | … | -->


### STEP-1 substeps (architecture sessions)

> Like every STEP, STEP-1 has **one owner**, run on one machine — substeps aren't split
> across people (see `runbooks/collaboration.md` §3). But architecture is a shared
> foundation, so **decide it as a group**: the best setup is the whole team in a room walking
> the sessions together while one person drives the keyboard and commits the docs.

<!-- Conditional sessions: enumerate every conditional-*.md template and include/defer/skip it
     in the STEP-1 PLAN's "Conditional sessions considered" table. Add an index row only when
     one is included. Slot included conditionals under a LETTERED substep after the related
     owning session, and run them BY NAME, not number (for example, "run the identity-auth
     session" → conditional-identity-auth.md). The output doc takes the next number above the
     core set. EXAMPLE ONLY — do not parse this as a real row; real rows start at the left
     margin above this comment, with the assigned substep and doc number:
       | 1.Xa | Conditional topic | Planned | `architecture/NN-topic.md` |
     If a conditional row is later added and then consciously not needed under the current
     project shape, mark it Deferred with the revisit trigger in the PLAN/risk register. -->
